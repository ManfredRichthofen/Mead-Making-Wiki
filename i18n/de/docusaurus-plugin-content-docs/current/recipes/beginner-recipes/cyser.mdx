## Method

1. Make sure that you [sanitize everything.](/process/sanitation)
2. In your [fermentation vessel](/resources/equipment), add room temperature honey, then add room temperature juice or
   fresh cider until the total volume of the must is 1 gallon or 4 liters, depending on your units.
3. Pour dry yeast into must. If you are looking to start a little more advanced, consider using goferm and rehydrating
   your yeast according to the package instructions.
4. Add the [DAP and Yeast Hulls.](/ingredients/nutrients)
5. If using a bucket, stir vigorously for 3-5 minutes. If using a carboy, seal with a cap or stopper and shake
   vigorously for 3-5 minutes, then unseal the container.
6. [Take and record a gravity reading, if desired.](/faq/hydrometer)
7. Close the container with a drilled stopper or drilled lid and airlock. Don't forget to add sanitizer or vodka to your
   airlock!
8. Place in a dark location at 60-75° F, 15-24° C.
9. Signs of fermentation should appear in 24-48 hours. Fermentation should complete in 1-2 weeks. This is highly
   variable depending upon dozens of factors.
10. When fermentation is complete, siphon the mead (it is now mead!) into a new vessel. Be careful not to splash too
    much, nor to suck up too much of the sediment on the bottom (but some doesn't hurt anything). At this stage, you can
    add the crushed campden tablet to the new vessel. The siphoning action should dissolve it sufficiently.
11. When it is clear enough that you can read a newspaper print through it, it is ready to [bottle](/process/packaging),
    but you can also allow it to [bulk age](/r/mead/wiki/process/aging).

## Additional Notes

This is a simple melomel mead, although technically a form of cyser. This is intended to finish sweet, and will be
drinkable sooner than dryer wines. It should be clear within a couple of months, and very drinkable within 3-6 months.
Like all wines, this will continue to improve with age.

US-05 yeast was chosen because of its relatively low alcohol tolerance, which should result in a sweet mead when
following this recipe.

If you replace US-05 with Lalvin 71B-1122, Lalvin D-45, Red Star Cote Des Blancs, Red Star Montrachet, or any wine yeast
with a 14% upper tolerance, you _may_ end up with a semi-sweet or off-dry mead. It will depend upon fermentation
conditions and the accuracy of your measurements. This could also produce a completely bone-dry (no residual sugar)
mead.

The fruit juice can be replaced with most organic fruit juices that do not contain preservatives. More advanced melomels
will use whole fruit. Purée fruit can be used as well. Juice and purée are often more readily available cheaply, in
bulk, than whole fruits.

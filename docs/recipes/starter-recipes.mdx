# Recipes

These recipes are only a starting place. There are thousands of mead recipes on the Internet. Ask your local homebrew shop or members of your club if they have recipes to share. Finally, branch out on your own and experiment!

Remember, recipes are as much method as ingredients. For best results, read the entire recipe a couple of times before you begin. It may help beginners to make a chronological list of actions, including the less glamorous steps - like ever-important sanitation!

The Beginner recipes are geared for simplicity and are scaled to one gallon batches. The instructions are thorough and assume very little knowledge of process. The rest are a little more advanced and calibrated for five gallon batches. They assume strong familiarity with process and only make note of non-obvious steps or considerations. These recipes can be readily scaled up or down. The yeast requirement may not scale linearly, however. An acceptable pitch rate is 1 to 5 grams per gallon; 2 grams per gallon is most commonly given as the "standard." Look at the packet of yeast to see how many grams it contains. It should be clearly marked.

Have fun!

    | Ingredient | Quantity | Notes |
    | :------: | :-----: | :--: |
    | Honey | 3.2 lbs | ~1.0L Choose your honey. Use orange blossom if you want a cheap, sure thing. Blueberry or Raspberry blossom are also good choices. |
    | Diammonium Phosphate | 1 tsp | |

#### Method

1. Make sure that you sanitize everything.
2. In your fermentation vessel, add room temperature honey, then add room temperature water until the total volume of the must is 1 gallon or 4 Liters depending on your units.
3. Pour dry yeast into must. If you are looking to start a little more advanced, consider using goferm and rehydrating your yeast according to the package instructions.
4. Boil the bakers yeast for 10 minutes in a small pan.
5. Add the DAP and Yeast Hulls.
6. If using a bucket, stir vigorously for 3-5 minutes. If using a carboy, seal with a cap or stopper and shake vigorously for 3-5 minutes, then unseal the container.
7. Take and record a gravity reading, if desired.
8. Close the container with a drilled stopper or drilled lid and airlock. Don't forget to add sanitizer or vodka to your airlock!
9. Place in a dark location at 60-75째 F, 15-24째 C.
10. Signs of fermentation should appear in 24-48 hours. Fermentation should complete in 1-2 weeks. This is highly variable depending upon dozens of factors.
11. When fermentation is complete, siphon the mead (it is now mead!) into a new vessel. Be careful not to splash too much, nor to suck up too much of the sediment on the bottom (but some doesn't hurt anything). At this stage, you can add the crushed campden tablet to the new vessel. The siphoning action should dissolve it sufficiently.
12. When it is clear enough that you can read a newspaper print through it, it is ready to bottle, but you can also allow it to bulk age.

#### Notes

This is a simple traditional mead. This is intended to finish sweet, and will be drinkable sooner than dryer wines. It should be clear within a couple of months, and very drinkable within 3-6 months. Like all wines, this will continue to improve with age.

US-05 yeast was chosen because of its relatively low alcohol tolerance, which should result in a sweet mead when following this recipe.

If you replace US-05 with Lalvin 71B-1122, Lalvin D-47, Red Star Cote Des Blancs, Red Star Montrachet, or any wine yeast with a 14% upper tolerance, you may end up with a dry or just off-dry mead. It will depend upon fermentation conditions and the accuracy of your measurements.

#### Notes

This is a simple spiced mead (metheglin). This is intended to finish sweet, and will be drinkable sooner than dryer wines. It should be clear within a couple of months, and very drinkable within 3-6 months. Like all wines, this will continue to improve with age.

US-05 yeast was chosen because of its relatively low alcohol tolerance, which should result in a sweet mead when following this recipe.

If you replace US-05 with Lalvin 71B-1122, Lalvin D-45, Red Star Cote Des Blancs, Red Star Montrachet, or any wine yeast with a 14% upper tolerance, you may end up with a semi-sweet or off-dry mead. It will depend upon fermentation conditions and the accuracy of your measurements. This could also produce a completely bone-dry (no residual sugar) mead.

This mead is obviously the same as the Traditional above, with spices added. Here are a few tips for making your own variations of this:

- Remember that in mead making, less is often more. Two or three flavors can mingle in more interesting ways than ten flavors.
- Be careful how much spice you use. It's easy to add more. It's nearly impossible to remove it if you overshoot. (But you can use that as marinade!)
- Nonetheless, be bold! People do want to taste the spice in their mouth. They don't want hints of it in the ether.
- Start with known-good flavor combinations. Try making a tea, sweetened with honey, of flavor combinations you aren't sure about.

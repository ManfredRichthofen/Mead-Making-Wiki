# Recipes

These recipes are only a starting place. There are thousands of mead recipes on the Internet. Ask your local homebrew
shop or members of your club if they have recipes to share. Finally, branch out on your own and experiment!

Remember, recipes are as much method as ingredients. For best results, read the entire recipe a couple of times before
you begin. It may help beginners to make a chronological list of actions, including the less glamorous steps - like
ever-important sanitation!

The Beginner recipes are geared for simplicity and are scaled to one gallon batches. The instructions are thorough and
assume very little knowledge of process. The rest are a little more advanced and calibrated for five gallon batches.
They assume strong familiarity with process and only make note of non-obvious steps or considerations. These recipes can
be readily scaled up or down. The yeast requirement may not scale linearly, however. An acceptable pitch rate is 1 to 5
grams per gallon; 2 grams per gallon is most commonly given as the "standard." Look at the packet of yeast to see how
many grams it contains. It should be clearly marked.
